What is JavaScript
- JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, object-oriented computer programming language 😅
	- “Lightweight” just means that the language doesn’t eat up much memory of the computer, and that it has a relatively simple syntax and features. 
	-  “Cross-platform” means that the languagecan be used on multiple platforms and systems, not just for web development.
	- “Object-oriented” means that it’s a language that’s based on objects.
- JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of web development. (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- Today, JavaScript can be used in differrent places:
	- Client-side: JavaScript was traditionally only used in the browser
	- Server-side: Thanks to ~node.js~, we can use JavaSript on the server as well
- Javascript is what made mordern web development possible:
	- Dynamic effects and interactivity
	- Modern web applications that we can interact with
- Frameworks/libraries like React and Angular are 100% based on JavaScript: you need to master JavaScript in order to use them!!!
