# What is JavaScript
- JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, object-oriented computer programming language 😅
	- *“Lightweight”* just means that the language doesn’t eat up much memory of the computer, and that it has a relatively simple syntax and features. 
	-  *“Cross-platform”* means that the languagecan be used on multiple platforms and systems, not just for web development.
	- *“Object-oriented”* means that it’s a language that’s based on objects.
- JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of web development. (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- Today, JavaScript can be used in differrent places:
	- **Client-side: JavaScript was traditionally only used in the browser**

- **Frameworks/libraries like React and Angular are 100% based on JavaScript: you need to master JavaScript in order to use them!!!**
